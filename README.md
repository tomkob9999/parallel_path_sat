# A Fast Path-Based Approach to 3-SAT Solving

### Abstract
This paper presents a novel path-based method for solving the **3-SAT problem**, leveraging **direct path expansion** instead of recursive backtracking. Unlike traditional solvers, which rely on branch-and-bound strategies, this approach **tracks variable assignments as immutable paths**, allowing for efficient deduplication and rapid UNSAT detection. The solver demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting UNSAT cases, often terminating within seconds for problem instances that would take significantly longer in other methods. The algorithm incorporates **variable scattering** to balance clause distribution, preventing localized complexity spikes. Additionally, a **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) extraction mode** enables direct conversion of SAT solutions into a structured form. 

This method is particularly effective in **constraint satisfaction problems**, **automated reasoning**, and **UNSAT detection**, making it a valuable tool in domains requiring rapid feasibility analysis.

### 1. Introduction
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a fundamental **NP-complete problem**, forming the basis of various computational fields, including **formal verification, combinatorial optimization, and artificial intelligence**. Traditional SAT solvers  use recursive **backtracking** and **heuristic-based pruning** to navigate the solution space.

This paper introduces an alternative **path-based expansion approach** that eliminates the need for **recursive backtracking** and instead **tracks valid paths explicitly**. The method is particularly advantageous for **UNSAT cases**, where contradictions propagate quickly, allowing for early termination. Additionally, the solver supports a **DNF extraction mode**, which reconstructs valid solutions into a structured Disjunctive Normal Form when SAT is detected.

### 2. Algorithm Overview

#### **2.1 Preprocessing: Variable Scattering**
Before solving, the algorithm applies a **variable scattering technique** to **evenly distribute variables** across clauses. This prevents highly concentrated dependencies and ensures **contradictions propagate faster**, leading to quicker UNSAT detection.

1. **Count variable occurrences** (positive/negative frequency).
2. **Sort clauses by diversity** (maximize unique variables, balance positive/negative literals).
3. **Shuffle in controlled chunks** to maintain structure while avoiding clustering.

This preprocessing step significantly improves performance by ensuring **uniform complexity distribution** across clauses.

#### **2.2 Path-Based Expansion**
Instead of using recursive backtracking, the solver initializes with a **single empty path** where all variables are unassigned (`0`). It then **expands paths** sequentially based on clause constraints:

1. **Each clause is processed independently**, modifying paths based on variable constraints.
2. **New paths are created whenever a valid assignment is found**, ensuring no restrictions on repeated assignments.
3. **Contradictory paths are discarded immediately**, leading to fast UNSAT detection.
4. **Duplicate paths are removed in O(1) time** using tuple-based deduplication.
5. **If all paths are invalidated, the formula is declared UNSAT**.

This approach **removes the need for recursion**, making it highly efficient in scenarios where early contradictions exist.

### 3. Conclusion
This paper introduces a **fast path-based approach** to 3-SAT solving, demonstrating **near-instant UNSAT detection** and structured **DNF extraction**. The method is well-suited for **constraint satisfaction, AI rule verification, and combinatorial optimization**, offering a novel alternative to traditional SAT solvers. Future work will focus on **hybridization and parallel scalability** to further enhance performance.
